# Study Hours vs Final Grade (Data Analysis Project)

## Overview
This project explores the relationship between the number of hours students study per week and their final grades. It was completed as part of the Coursera Data Analytics Certificate, Course 1 and Corse 2.

## Objective
To analyze whether there's a correlation between study time and academic performance using Microsoft Excel.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for data cleaning, analysis, and charting)
- GitHub (for project documentation and sharing)

## Key Insights
1. There isn’t a clear trend between study hours and grades—some students with low hours scored high, and vice versa.
2. Several students studied fewer than 5 hours and scored over 80%, showing other factors may impact performance.
3. More study hours didn’t always result in better grades—some who studied 15+ hours still scored low.
