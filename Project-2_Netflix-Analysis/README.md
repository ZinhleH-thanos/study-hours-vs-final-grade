# Netflix vs Non-Screen Relaxation (Data Analysis Project)

## Overview
This project explores how people divide their time between watching Netflix and engaging in offline relaxing activities. It was completed as part of the Coursera Data Analytics Certificate, Course 2: *Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions*.

## Objective
To compare time spent on screen-based vs non-screen-based relaxation, and uncover trends in behavior using Excel pivot tables and charts.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (for pivot table creation, analysis, and column charting)
- GitHub (for version control and documentation)

## Key Insights
1. Most people spend more time on Netflix than on relaxing offline.
2. Person I shows a strong preference for Netflix with 15 hours, compared to just 1 hour of non-screen relaxing.
3. There may be a trend where people who spend less time on screens compensate with more offline relaxation.
